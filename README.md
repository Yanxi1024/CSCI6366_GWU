## Cat Sound Classification
We conducted transfer learning based on ResNet18, ResNet50, and EfficientNetV2-S to classify a dataset of cat sounds. We wrote a paper for this project: https://raphael.quarto.pub/meownetwebpage/

## Duck Classification
We used a custom CNN to learn from a dataset of duck images, implementing a binary classification task to identify whether a photo contains a duck. Additionally, we performed transfer learning on this dataset using ResNet152, creating a binary classifier based on ResNet152.

## MNIST
We designed a CNN to complete the classic MNIST task.
